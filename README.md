## About

The Python [eventsourcing library](http://eventsourcing.readthedocs.io) revolves around using domain events as a persistence mechanism in event sourced domain driven applications. In the article accompanying this code we take our first steps into building an event sourced domain driven application using the library by adapting our pure Python domain model to use the library's domain modelling tools.

This tutorial and code is specific to the Python eventsourcing library and builds on the pure domain model built in this post: https://github.com/zarekr/python-real-world-domain-model (a standalone tutorial).
